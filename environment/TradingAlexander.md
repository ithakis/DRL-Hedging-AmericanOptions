#### **1. Integration Points of `Utils` Class**

The `Utils` class is primarily leveraged in the following areas:

1. **Initialization of Simulation Environment:**
   - **Method Used:** `init_env()`
   - **Purpose:** Sets up the simulation environment by generating simulated asset prices (`a_price`) and volatilities (`vol`) based on the configured stochastic process (e.g., Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) or Heston model).

   - **Methods Used:** `agg_poisson_dist` and `atm_hedges`
   - **Purpose:** 
     - `agg_poisson_dist`: Creates a liability portfolio by aggregating options that arrive according to a Poisson process.
     - `atm_hedges`: Constructs a hedging portfolio comprising at-the-money (ATM) options to manage gamma and vega risks dynamically.

3. **Configuration Parameters:**
   - **Attributes Used:** `spread`, `contract_size`, and other simulation parameters.
   - **Purpose:** Provides configuration settings such as transaction costs (`spread`) and contract sizing, which are essential for accurate portfolio simulations and hedging strategies.

#### **3. Workflow Illustration**

1. **Initialization Phase:**
   - An instance of the `Utils` class is created with the desired simulation and hedging parameters.
   - The `MainPortfolio` class is instantiated with the `Utils` object, triggering the initialization of simulation paths and the creation of liability and hedging portfolios.

2. **Simulation Phase:**
   - The `init_env()` method of `Utils` generates simulated asset prices and volatilities.
   - The `agg_poisson_dist` method is invoked to simulate the stochastic arrival of options into the liability portfolio.
   - The `atm_hedges` method is used to generate a series of ATM options for the hedging portfolio.

3. **Operational Phase:**
   - During each simulation step, hedging actions are taken based on the agent's decisions, leveraging the `Portfolio.add()` method which calculates transaction costs using `utils.spread`.
   - The portfolio's value and risk profiles (delta, gamma, vega) are continuously updated using the aggregated data from the liability and hedging portfolios.

4. **Post-Simulation Phase:**
   - Results are aggregated, and the portfolio state can be saved or loaded using serialization mechanisms, ensuring consistency and reproducibility through the `Utils` configuration.
